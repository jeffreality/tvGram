## Overview

The TVgram application is a Swift/tvOS app that loads a set of Instagram photos, sorts them by the total number of comments or likes, and displays them in a Collection View.

A segmented control lets the user change whether they are sorted by total comments or total likes.

The number (for either total likes or total comments depending on the current filter) is displayed at the bottom of the thumbnail image.
